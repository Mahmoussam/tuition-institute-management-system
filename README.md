# TCMS : tuition institute management system
-------------------------------------------
I worked on this project  back at 2020 ,I don't remember where "TCMS" came from xD
TCMS is a management system based on central mysql server DB <SQL> ,java +swing+ JDBC driver
It provides the following:

[+] Create,Delete, schedule ,make reports for each course/class

[+] Calculate profit for each course ,allows "Custom equations" in string form to calculate profit for both a teacher and manager.
  This is achieved using Jython ,utilizing python interpreter to evaluate the equations in pythonic sense, which is mostly mathmatical..
    
[+] registering students / teachers and making/storing related reports and tables

[+] may support barcode readers ,as a student can get a UID

Currently the DB scheme is missing ,along with other jar files.
although not completely done ,but as i remember it was mostly done
